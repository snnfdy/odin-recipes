    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe was made in my best friend's family for years. She has since passed it on to me. The children love it!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>  
        <li>1⅓ cups water</li> 
        <li>2 (1 ounce) packages taco seasoning mix (such as McCormick® Original)</li>    
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can hot chili beans, undrained</li>    
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bag nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as Doritos®)</li> 
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly and browned, about 10 minutes; drain grease. Mix water and taco seasoning mix into ground beef, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer ground beef mixture, stirring often, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat chili beans in a saucepan over low heat until simmering.</li>
        <li>Spread layers of tortilla chips, ground beef mixture, and chili beans, respectively into a casserole dish; repeat layers until you run out of chips, beef, and beans. Top casserole with Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and tips of exposed tortilla chips are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
  
    </ol>
